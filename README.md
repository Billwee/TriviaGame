## Overview

Welcome to my Simpsons Trivia Game. As a huge fan of the show I was very excited to create this to test people's knowledge of America's favorite cartoon family!

When the page first loads you're presented with a button to start the game. Once pressed it loads an image of Bart Simpson standing in front of a chalkboard. The questions and 15 second timer are all loaded onto this image throughout the game. Below the image there is a grid of four answer choices for the user to select from.

When an answer choice is made by the user the whole question and choices section will disappear and a new display will appear telling you if you were correct, incorrect, or ran out of time for that question. This display will also load an .gif related to the question asked regardless of choice. This is all displayed for 4 seconds, then the chalkboard, answer grid, and next question appear.

After all twenty-five questions are asked you are taken to a display which shows how many questions you answered correctly, incorrectly, and didn't answer after running out of time. Under that a button appears that asks the user if they would like to play the same game again. Good luck and eat my shorts!
